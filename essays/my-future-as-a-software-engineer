As an aspiring software engineer, I’m interested in web and mobile app development. Mobile devices, such as phones and tablets, have become our handiest tool. Whether we need to find driving directions, use a calculator, plan events, etc., there is an app we can use! I’d like to learn the skills to create new apps that will be useful for the future. This involves skills such as UI/UX designing, handling data, and more.

My interest in front-end development began recently when I was part of a team to develop a web application. It was a difficult experience because I had no previous experience, but I had a great time learning about how to make a website. I got to work with a UI designer and create his design for the website. The fun part was writing code and watching the changes appear right on the screen. I learned how to see things from a user’s perspective and develop an eye for details and features.

In the future, I’d like to be a software engineer in this type of field. Ideally, I want to work with how users interact with an online platform. From navigating web pages to the buttons and tables on the application, the front-end is a critical part of connecting people with services. I would like to gain more experience with developing a full application and learning mobile app development in the future.

I’d also like to have more experience with working in teams. It’s fun to collaborate on a project when everything goes well. I sometimes have difficulty communicating my ideas and finding the rights words to use. Working with teams would be a great way for me to improve both my soft skills and coding. I hope to have more great experiences with collaboration and dalton-end development.
