<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/degree_difficulty.jpg">*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked the question earlier last week -- why is it so hard to be an officer for the student branch? Why is so hard compared to working at my on-campus job? This question came after he struggled a little with bookkeeping for the student organization.

Now I gave him the standard answer - being an officer of an organization requires that you manage your time between school and work. There isn't anyone telling you what to do. It's the answer any good mentor would give, and is mostly true.

But the more I though about it, the more I wondered to myself...damn that's a really great question; it's one that deserves some more thought. Most people I think stop at the answer I gave previously - he obviously isn't managing his time properly.

Here's what I think: the difficult things will always be difficult.

## Great things about high-level languages

Being a computer engineering major, I have been educated in lower-level programming languages such as assembly code and C/C++. In comparison to these languages, Javascript is easy to pick up because it automatically allocates and frees memory, which is arguably the most confusing part about C/C++. I remember it took me months to understand pointers and references, especially with data structures such as binary search trees. Another plus is that I donâ€™t have to declare variables as much in Javascript. From a software engineering perspective, I think certain data structures and manipulations are easier to solve in Javascript and I would highly consider using it for coding interviews.

One really useful trick I learned from the ES6 module in freecodecamp.com was the ternary operator. For example, the following function determines if a number is odd.

```JavaScript
function isOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    return false;
  else {
    return true;
}

Instead of using an if, else statement, I could write this function as:

function isOdd(number) {
  return (number % 2 == 0 ? false : true);
}
```

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
