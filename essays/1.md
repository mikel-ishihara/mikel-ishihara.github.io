##What is a good question?

Asking the right questions is an important skill for software engineers. Good questions lead to helpful answers that are important for learning. On the other hand, a bad question can be misleading and hinder progress. Therefore, it is important to understand what makes good questions. 

A good question is concise and provides relevant information. For example, relevant information could be the programming language and version being used or the specific error reference. Additionally, the question should show a train of thinking or effort towards the problem. This leads the one answering the question to continue that effort to a solution that is easy to understand.

##Does it matter if I ask smart questions?

There are good reasons to ask smart questions. It is a necessary skill to be a better professional, especially as a software engineer. In a field where fundamental programming languages are being updated and new topics are being explored, a software engineer likely does not know the answer to every problem. StackOverFlow has been a great source for anyone looking for help with programming issues.

An example of a question asked in a “not smart way” is: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61858019/my-code-is-supposed-to-reject-inputs-that-do-not-contain-all-letters-of-the-alph

The header does not provide a precise problem, which is reflected by the comments that ask for more details about the problem. Additionally, the header and lack of detail in the tags result in small engagement with the community. The single answer that is given also has uncertainty in what the question is about, which leads to the answer being based on certain assumptions.

An example of a question asked in a “smart way” is:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it

The header reflects what the asker wants to know and provides more information in his/her post. The asker provides specific tags and the JavaScript compiler that is running the code. The post also specifies the information that he/she is seeking. The post has high community engagement and the answers provided by the community are detailed and provide links and example code.
