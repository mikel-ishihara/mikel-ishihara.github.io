##What is a smart question?

Asking the right questions is an important skill for software engineers. Smart questions lead to helpful answers that are important for learning. On the other hand, a not smart question can be misleading and hinder progress. Therefore, it is important to understand what makes smart questions. 

A smart question is concise and provides relevant information. For example, relevant information could be the programming language and version being used or the specific error reference. Additionally, the question should show a train of thinking or effort towards the problem. This leads the one answering the question to continue that effort to a solution that is easy to understand.

##Does it matter if the question I ask is smart?

There are good reasons to ask smart questions. It is a necessary skill to be a better professional, especially as a software engineer. In a field where fundamental programming languages are being updated and new topics are being explored, a software engineer likely does not know the answer to every problem. StackOverFlow has been a great source for anyone looking for help with programming issues.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it) is an example of a smart question that is returned with relevant answers. The asker wants to know about using a specific statement in JavaScript. The post has relevant information about the compiler being used and shows the context of the question. The post also has specific tags so that it is found by experienced JavaScript users that can answer the question. The quality of the question is reflected by the high engagement and detailed answers with links and example code.


[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61858019/my-code-is-supposed-to-reject-inputs-that-do-not-contain-all-letters-of-the-alph)
 is an example of a question that is ineffectively asked. The person asking wants to know how to fix a block of code. The header states that the code does not work and needs to be fixed. However, the lack of detail in the prompt makes the question difficult to answer. The ones that see the question are asking more questions to clarify the problem, rather than answering. The one person that provided an answer explicitly states the assumptions that he/she is using to provide an answer. Ultimately, the question cannot be provided with a good answer, which causes frustration for both the person asking and the people trying to answer the question.
